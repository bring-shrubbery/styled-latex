# Styled Latex Components

> Archiving, because nobody should use styled-components.

## Description

This repo provides a set of [styled-components]() that can be used to compose a [React.js]() document that looks like [Latex]() document. These components are almost completely separate from each other, so you can put just some of them into your project.

## Credits

### Inspiration

This project takes a lot of styles from Latex.css project by [Vincent Dörig](https://github.com/vincentdoerig) that you can find [here](https://github.com/vincentdoerig/latex-css).
